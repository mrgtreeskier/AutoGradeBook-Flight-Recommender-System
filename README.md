# AutoGradeBook-Flight-Recommender-System
Master's thesis work and prototypical recommender system for automated flight event suggestions

# Abstract
The Air Forceâ€™s Pilot Training Next (PTN) program seeks a more efficient pilot training environment emphasizing the use of virtual reality flight simulators alongside periodic real aircraft experience. The PTN program wants to accelerate the training pace and progress in undergraduate pilot training compared to traditional undergraduate pilot training. Currently, instructor pilots spend excessive time planning and scheduling flights. This research focuses on methods to auto-generate the planning of in-flight events using hybrid filtering and deep learning techniques.  The resulting approach captures temporal trends of user-specific and program-wide student performance to recommend a feasible set of graded flight events for evaluation in a student's next training exercise to improve their progress toward fully qualified status.
